Thread Scheduler - 
A component of Java that decides which thread to run or execute and which thread to wait is called a thread scheduler in Java. 
There are two factors for scheduling a thread i.e. 
Priority - Priority of each thread lies between 1 to 10.
Time of arrival -  arrival time of thread is considered by the thread scheduler

First Come First Serve Scheduling:
In this scheduling algorithm, the scheduler picks the threads thar arrive first in the runnable queue.

Time-slicing scheduling:
Usually, the First Come First Serve algorithm is non-preemptive, which is bad as it may lead to infinite blocking (also known as starvation).
To avoid that, some time-slices are provided to the threads so that after some time, the running thread has to give up the CPU.
Thus, the other waiting threads also get time to run their job.

Preemptive-Priority Scheduling:
Suppose there are multiple threads available in the runnable state. The thread scheduler picks that thread that has the highest priority. 
Since the algorithm is also preemptive, therefore, time slices are also provided to the threads to avoid starvation. 
Thus, after some time, even if the highest priority thread has not completed its job, it has to release the CPU because of preemption.
