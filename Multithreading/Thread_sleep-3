Thread.sleep method -

Whenever the Thread.sleep() methods execute, it always halts the execution of the current thread.

Whenever another thread does interruption while the current thread is already in the sleep mode, then the InterruptedException is thrown.

public static void sleep(long mls) throws InterruptedException   --> native method
public static void sleep(long mls, int n) throws InterruptedException   --> non native method

he native, as well as the non-native method, throw a checked Exception. Therefore, either try-catch block or the throws keyword can work here.

 sleep() Method in Java: When the sleeping time is -ive
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: timeout value is negative
