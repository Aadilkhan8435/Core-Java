Daemon Thread -

Daemon thread in Java is a service provider thread that provides services to the user thread. 
Its life depend on the mercy of user threads i.e. when all the user threads dies, JVM terminates this thread automatically.

There are many java daemon threads running automatically e.g. gc, finalizer etc.

It is a low priority thread.

Methods for Java Daemon thread by Thread class
1)	public void setDaemon(boolean status)	is used to mark the current thread as daemon thread or user thread.
2)	public boolean isDaemon()	is used to check that current is daemon.

Note: If you want to make a user thread as Daemon, it must not be started otherwise it will throw IllegalThreadStateException.


**********************************

Thread Pool - 
Java Thread pool represents a group of worker threads that are waiting for the job and reused many times.

Better performance It saves time because there is no need to create a new thread.

The accurate size of a thread pool is decided by the number of available processors and the type of tasks the threads have to execute.

ThreadGroup in Java 
Java provides a convenient way to group multiple threads in a single object. In such a way, we can suspend, resume or interrupt a group of threads by a single method call.

ThreadGroup tg1 = new ThreadGroup("Group A");   
Thread t1 = new Thread(tg1,new MyRunnable(),"one");     
Thread t2 = new Thread(tg1,new MyRunnable(),"two");     
Thread t3 = new Thread(tg1,new MyRunnable(),"three");
