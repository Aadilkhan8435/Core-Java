Constructors -->

In Java, a constructor is a block of codes similar to the method. It is called when an instance of the class is created. At the time of calling constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory.
It is a special type of method which is used to initialize the object.
Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called.
It calls a default constructor if there is no constructor available in the class. In such case, Java compiler provides a default constructor by default.

There are two types of constructors in Java:
Default constructor (no-arg constructor)
Parameterized constructor


Constructor Overloading in Java
In Java, a constructor is just like a method but without return type. It can also be overloaded like Java methods.
Constructor overloading in Java is a technique of having more than one constructor with different parameter lists. 
They are arranged in a way that each constructor performs a different task. They are differentiated by the compiler by the number of parameters in the list and their types.

Does constructor return any value?
Yes, it is the current class instance (You cannot use return type yet it returns a value).

Is there Constructor class in Java?
Yes.
Java provides a Constructor class which can be used to get the internal information of a constructor in the class. It is found in the java.lang.reflect package.
