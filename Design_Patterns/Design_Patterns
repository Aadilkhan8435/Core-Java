Design Patterns -

A design patterns are well-proved solution for solving the specific problem/task.

But remember one-thing, design patterns are programming language independent strategies for solving the common object-oriented design problems.
That means, a design pattern represents an idea, not a particular implementation.

By using the design patterns you can make your code more flexible, reusable and maintainable.

The "Gang of Four" (GoF) design patterns refer to a collection of 23 design patterns

Types - 
1.Creational Design Pattern - These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
                              focus on the process of object creation in software design.
  - Factory Pattern
  - Singleton Pattern
  - Builder Pattern.


2. Structural Design Pattern - These patterns focus on how classes and objects can be composed to form larger structures.
  - Facade Pattern


3. Behavioral Design Pattern - These patterns deal with object interaction and responsibility.
                               focus on communication between objects and the delegation of responsibilities
