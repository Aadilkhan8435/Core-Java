Object class - 

The Object class is the parent class of all the classes in java by default. In other words, it is the topmost class of java.
The Object class is beneficial if you want to refer any object whose type you don't know. 
 Notice that parent class reference variable can refer the child class object, know as upcasting.

Object obj=getObject();//we don't know what object will be returned from this method
